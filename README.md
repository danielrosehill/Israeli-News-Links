# Israeli News Links & RSS Feeds

## Purpose Statement

The purpose of this repository is to aggregate a collection of links which may be useful for those wishing to monitor ongoing news developments in Israel.

I assembled this collection of links for my own preparedness (I live in Israel!) in order to create a few monitoring dashboards to run 24/7. My sole motivation in open-sourcing this small link bundle is to help others to do the same and to save myself from having to fish out the same links repeatedly.

The selection of sources is often guided by asking *"who still provides an RSS feed in the year 2024?"* and doesn't always reflect my own political alignments. 

## Exclusions

Telegram groups whose links are not in the public domain.
